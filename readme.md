# Diff Explorer

## Description

Diff Explorer is a simple Python application built with Tkinter that allows users to compare the differences between two text files. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to load two files, and then it displays the lines that have been modified between the two files, similar to the output of `git diff`.
